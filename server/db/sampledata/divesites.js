We had a position from the harbormaster, and many divers ran many search patterns looking for them to no avail.  There were multiple reports of one anchor a concrete block and a pile of chain at about the location of  anchor 01.  Finally,  in September, 2006, it all came together.  First a diver named James reported that there was a second anchor in a pile of chain in the general vicinity of anchor 01.  Then Marcos Perreau Guimaraes reported finding another anchor, with a bunch of chain, and it looked like the chain had been cut.  I went and checked them out.  James\' anchor was really two anchors (02 and 03) and a concrete block, and Marcos anchor was 04.  The cruise ship had cut the chain!',

There are two more, in better condition, one resting partially on the other (mating? ;-), in the sand at about 80\' off Lover\'s Point.  They were originally found by Holger Fuerst.  Why two in one place?  One theory is a collision.  Another is that they were moored together (there\'s a large concrete mooring block nearby), one sprang a leak and dragged the other down with it.',

The Barge is close to the line from the end of the breakwater to the mile buoy and there\'s a fair amount of boat traffic, so you want to follow the anchor line back to the surface and come up next to your boat.  If you MUST surface away from the boat, swim SSW toward the breakwater on your safety stops.  You do NOT want to surface offshore from your boat as that\'s where the boat traffic will generally be.
